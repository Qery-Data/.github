# Qery AS

Qery is a Norwegian data analysis company focusing on analysing and visualising social and economic trends.

Working with data from international providers such as the United Nations, the World Bank, the International Labor Organization, Eurostat and the OECD, our goal is to create clear, insightful and accessible reports, data trackers and visualisations.

Qery is run by Alf Åge Lønne. You can [get in touch](mailto:alf.lonne@qery.no) to discuss custom data analysis and visualizations, or if you have any suggestions or comments about our work.
